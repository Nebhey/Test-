## Work done this week
  * Finished the Git path on code school. Even if some elements may be a bit unclear, most of the tools on sharing document are mastered. 
  * Conception of an industry list that reports all the protectionist measures present in the different votes of the TAA. It aims at showing the action of lobbies applying pressure on Congressmen in order to protect their tariff based competitive advantage.
  * Correction of the different documents that were uploaded last week

## Content of the meeting
  * Key questions about the background of tariff negotiation: what is the pattern in the adoption of the TAA? How does the opposition of the TAA change through time? Do we see some sectors put out of the tariff negotiation?
  * Practical problems: research on how to make tables under markdown

##work for the weeek
  * start reading the second book, _Traders and diplomats_ and the third book _The GATT legal system and World Trade Diplomacy_ by Robert Hudec
  * some questions need to answered in order to define the  role of the TAA in the definition of the background of the model:
      * Is the TAA relevant in multilateral negotiations like the GATT? Is the extension of the TAA linked to the negotiation at the GATT? If yes, how? 
      * How does the TAA exactly condition the president action when negotiating? Does it have any resemblance with the fast-track procedures in the 2000s?
      * What is the exact pattern of the tariffs in force for the different industries? Do we observe a decrease linked of the general level coupled with a carving out action regarding strategic industries or industries supported by big lobbies?
